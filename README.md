### Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

## Project Overview
The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to enhance the transportation industry by providing 
a solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. Utilizing Selenium for web scraping,
this project automates the extraction of detailed information from the Redbus website, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.
The data is then stored in a structured SQL database.

A Streamlit application was developed to display and filter the scraped data, offering interactive filtering options based on bus type, 
route, price range, star rating, and availability. Users can seamlessly explore the data, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making, 
significantly improving operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

## Key Achievements
**Data Scraping**: Successfully scraped data for government and private buses, ensuring high accuracy and completeness.
**Data Storage**: Efficiently stored the data in a SQL database with a well-designed schema.
**Streamlit Application**: Developed an intuitive and responsive application for dynamic data filtering, enhancing user experience and enabling effective data exploration.
